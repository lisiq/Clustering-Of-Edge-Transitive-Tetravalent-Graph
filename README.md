# Clustering-Of-Edge-Transitive-Tetravalent-Graph

In this project I scrape data from https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~swilson/C4FullSite/BigTable.html and cluster the graphs using K-means clustering, Heirarchical clustering and DBSCAN clustering. I present the results in a project paper titeled: Clustering Edge Transitive Tetravalent Graphs, which is also uploaded here.
